# 📁 ASSET — Image Research & Reference Collector


**Asset** is a lightweight tool made for **creators, designers, marketers, and content researchers** to quickly gather visual references during brainstorming or content development.  
It pulls image results via **SerpAPI**, caches them for later access, and opens a **keyboard-controlled image viewer** where you can browse, filter visually, and selectively save only what you want — making research fast, organized, and clutter-free.
